# OrderedEnumComparator

`OrderedEnumComparator` is the most basic decorator for `OrderedEnum` class.
It expects a function, which compares two values of the same `TEnum` type,
where `TEnum` is `OrderedEnum` or one of it's heirs.

Other decorators described in this documentation use `OrderedEnumComparator`.
